# nosql-challenge


In challenge 12 we had several parts to this assignment. 

Part 1 was to pull in the uk-foods database from MongoDB, which was a list of many different food establishments in the Uk, into jupyter notebook and make sure we had all the data there to explore.

Part 2 was to go in and update the file with a new resturant, take out all the resturants that are located in Dover, and to update Latitude and Longitude to make them a Double.

Part 3 was to create dataframes with different variable that we were looking for. Such as, Rating Values, good hygiene scores, and find with places had the highest and lowest scores in the date base.
